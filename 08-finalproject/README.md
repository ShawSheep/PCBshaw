**Inspiration**

The initial inspiration came from a visit to the Youth Forest Park. As I lay on a grassy field, closing my eyes to immerse myself in the surroundings, I felt the air around me growing cooler. After conducting research, I discovered that part of the reason for the cooler air was the plant's life activities causing a localized temperature drop, creating subtle air currents. Another reason was the gradual tranquility of the mind after interacting with plants, establishing a resonance.
Hence, I created this installation with the aim of fostering an understanding of the connection between the essence of plants and the human spirit. It senses human emotions through breathing frequency, activating when individuals slow their breath and take three to five deep breaths in its direction. The installation then initiates a gentle breeze, causing the plants to sway, providing a soothing and relaxing experience, generating a delicate resonance with nature.

**Design description**

When walking into the urban ecological grassland and lying on it, one feels the air around becoming cooler, a result of the plant's life activity. 
However, if a person's mood isn't calm enough, it's difficult to perceive the subtle airflow generated by the plants.
**FLORA RESONANCE** aims to allow people to rediscover the profound connection between urban ecology and emotions through interactive plant installations. 
The system senses people's emotional states by their breathing frequency. When individuals slow down their breathing rhythm, the device activates, causing the plants to sway and create a gentle breeze, offering solace and relaxation, establishing a delicate resonance with the plants.
